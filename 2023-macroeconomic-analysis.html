    <h2>Zimbabwe 2023 Macroeconomic Analysis</h2>
    <p>I created this project in the run-up to Zimbabwe’s August 2023 elections. With so much speculation and confusion surrounding the economy, I wanted to offer a clear, data-driven picture based on official sources. Using datasets from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, and ZIMSTAT, I explored the country’s economic landscape to better understand the real facts — not opinion.</p>
    
    <p>The result is a comprehensive analysis that covers inflation, currency volatility, trade balances, and key fiscal and monetary policy actions. The dashboard uses interactive visuals and storytelling techniques to provide deeper insight into how the Zimbabwean economy performed during this critical year.</p>

    <h3>Project Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interactive data on inflation, exchange rates, and imports/exports</li>
      <li>Visual storytelling using economic indicators and timelines</li>
      <li>Contextual analysis of monetary and fiscal policy actions</li>
      <li>Clean, dynamic Tableau dashboard for exploration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sourcing the Data</h2>
    <p>
      The analysis relies on official data from the <a href="https://zimbabwe.opendataforafrica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zimbabwe Open Data for Africa portal</a>, which consolidates statistics from key institutions including the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, and the Ministry of Finance & Economic Development.  
    </p>
    <p>
      After downloading the datasets, light cleaning and minor adjustments were performed in Excel before importing the data into Tableau for detailed analysis and visualisation.

    <h2>Visualising Economic Indicators</h2>
    <p>
      Given the volume and diversity of the economic datasets, the visualisations and dashboards were thoughtfully organised into five distinct themes for clarity and focused analysis:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>GDP:</strong> Exploring economic growth trends starting from March 2019, including metrics like GDP, GNI, and related growth indicators.<br />
      <strong>Trade:</strong> Detailing imports, exports, trade balances, and direction of trade to understand Zimbabwe’s international commerce.<br />
      <strong>Monetary Policy:</strong> Tracking key indicators such as inflation, exchange rates, money supply growth, and interest rates.<br />
      <strong>Labour Force:</strong> Analysing employment rates, informal employment, and income distribution patterns.<br />
      <strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong> Reviewing government fiscal surplus, debt ratios, and remittances affecting the economy.
    </p>

    <h2>Visualising Data Sources</h2>
    <p>
      To clearly communicate the origin and scope of the datasets used, I created a dedicated dashboard that maps each data source to the relevant dashboards, metrics, frequency, and date range. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This interactive chart displays the coverage period of each source along a timeline with years on the x-axis, illustrating how many years of data each source provides. It also highlights which metrics belong to which data source and which dashboards use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users can interact with each data point to access the original data source directly, providing transparency and easy verification of the data underpinning the analysis.
